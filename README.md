# User Service

This microservice provides a REST interface for managing user entities. It is built with Java and Spring Boot 2, and uses an H2 database for persistence.

## Getting Started

To run the User Service locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Build the project using Maven: `mvn clean package`
4. Run the application: `java -jar target/user-service.jar`

The User Service will start running on `http://localhost:8080`.

## API Documentation

The User Service exposes the following endpoints:

- `GET /users`: Get a list of all users.
- `GET /users/{id}`: Get a user by ID.
- `POST /users`: Create a new user.
- `PUT /users/{id}`: Update an existing user.
- `DELETE /users/{id}`: Delete a user by ID.

For more details on the API endpoints and request/response examples, refer to the API documentation.

## Deployments

The User Service can be deployed using Docker and Kubernetes. The project includes the necessary Dockerfile, deployment.yaml, and service.yaml files.

To deploy the User Service to a Kubernetes cluster, follow these steps:

1. Build the Docker image: `docker build -t user-service .`
2. Push the Docker image to a container registry.
3. Apply the Kubernetes deployment and service configurations: `kubectl apply -f deployment.yaml -f service.yaml`

The User Service will be deployed to the Kubernetes cluster and will be accessible via the assigned service URL.

## Why This Project is Efficient

1. **Microservice Architecture**: The User Service is designed as a microservice, which allows for independent deployment and scalability. By separating the user management functionality into its own microservice, it becomes easier to maintain and scale the application based on specific needs.

2. **Spring Boot**: The project leverages the Spring Boot framework, which offers a lightweight and opinionated approach to building Java applications. Spring Boot provides auto-configuration and convention-over-configuration features, reducing the boilerplate code and allowing for rapid development.

3. **H2 Database**: The User Service uses the H2 in-memory database for persistence. The in-memory nature of H2 enables fast read and write operations, making it suitable for development and testing purposes. Additionally, H2 can easily be replaced with other production-ready databases without significant changes to the codebase.

4. **Efficient API Design**: The User Service exposes a RESTful API that follows industry-standard best practices. It utilizes the HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for appropriate operations and adheres to the principles of resource-based API design. This ensures efficiency in communication between clients and the service.

5. **Testing Strategies**: The project includes comprehensive unit tests, integration tests, and controller tests to verify the functionality of the User Service. By adopting a test-driven development approach, it ensures that the code is reliable and behaves as expected in different scenarios. The tests can be run automatically during the build process or as part of a continuous integration pipeline.

6. **Containerization with Docker**: The User Service can be containerized using Docker, providing a lightweight and portable deployment option. Docker containers encapsulate the application and its dependencies, ensuring consistency and reproducibility across different environments.

7. **Orchestration with Kubernetes**: The project includes Kubernetes deployment and service configurations, enabling easy deployment and scaling of the User Service in a Kubernetes cluster. Kubernetes provides automatic scaling, load balancing, and self-healing capabilities, making it efficient for managing containerized applications.

By incorporating these efficient practices and technologies, the User Service is designed to deliver high performance, scalability, and maintainability, ensuring an optimal user management solution.
